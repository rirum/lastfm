## Lastfm Top Tracks

This project aim to consume the LastFm API and get all the tracks that your user scrobbled since the creation of your account. 

### Motivation

I just wanted an easy way to get all the tracks that I listened since I downloaded LastFm plugin and I wanted to train Python!
Later on I'd want to transform this list into a Spotify's playlist.

### What you'll need to use this
- a lastFm account
- a lastFm API account

  populate your .env with your user and your API_KEY (will set a .env_example soon!)
  

### to be done
- get this list and make a Spotify's playlist.
